    <p>
        The Personal Software Process (PSP) is an ordered software development process created 
        by Watts Humphrey and applies the capability maturity model of the Software Engineering 
        Institute's (SEI). PSP is aimed at helping software engineers understand and improve 
        their performance, through the use of disciplined, data-driven procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Personal Software ProcessSM (PSPSM) provides engineers with a disciplined personal
        framework for doing software work. The PSP process consists of a set of methods, forms, and
        scripts that show software engineers how to plan, measure, and manage their work. It is introduced
        with a textbook and a course that are designed for both industrial and academic use.
    </p>
    <p>
         The PSP is designed for use with any programming language or design methodology and it
        can be used for most aspects of software work, including writing requirements, running tests,
        defining processes, and repairing defects. When engineers use the PSP, the recommended
        process goal is to produce zero-defect products on schedule and within planned costs. When
        used with the Team Software ProcessSM (TSPSM), the PSP has been effective in helping engineers
        achieve these objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting with a requirements statement, the first step in the PSP process is planning. 
        There is a planning script that guides this work and a plan summary for recording the 
        planning data. While the engineers are following the script to do the work, they record 
        their time and defect data on the time and defect logs. At the end of the job, during the 
        postmortem phase (PM), they summarize the time and defect data from the logs, measure the 
        program size, and enter these data in the plan summary form. When done, they deliver the 
        finished product along with the completed plan summary form.
